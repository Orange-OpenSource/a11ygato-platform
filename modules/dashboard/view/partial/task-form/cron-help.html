<h4>CRON Ranges</h4>

<p>When specifying your cron values you'll need to make sure that your values fall within the ranges.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Minutes: 0-59</li>
    <li>Hours: 0-23</li>
    <li>Day of Month: 1-31</li>
    <li>Months: 1-12</li>
    <li>Day of Week: 0-6</li>
</ul>

<h4>CRON Patterns</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Asterisk. E.g. *</li>
    <li>Ranges. E.g. 1-3</li>
    <li>Lists. E.g. 1-3,5</li>
    <li>Steps. E.g. */2</li>
</ul>

<p>A  field  may  be an asterisk (*), which always stands for
    ``first-last''.</p>

<p>Ranges  are  two  numbers
    separated  with  a  hyphen.  The specified range is inclu-
    sive.  For example, 8-11 for an ``hours'' entry  specifies
    execution at hours 8, 9, 10 and 11.</p>

<p>A list is a set of numbers (or ranges)
    separated by commas.  Examples: ``1,2,5,9'', ``0-4,8-12''.</p>

<p>Step  values can be used in conjunction with ranges.  Fol-
    lowing a range with ``/<number>'' specifies skips  of  the
        number's value through the range.  For example, ``0-23/2''
        can be used in the hours field to specify  command  execu-
        tion  every other hour (the alternative in the V7 standard
        is ``0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22'').   Steps  are  also
        permitted after an asterisk, so if you want to say ``every
        two hours'', just use ``*/2''.</p>

<p><strong>Last but not least, dates are relatives to UTC. So if you are in timezone "Europe/Paris" (UTC+1) and want to schedule something at 4:10PM every day, you will write <span class='keyword'>10 15 * * *</span> instead of <span class='keyword'>10 16 * * *</span></strong></p>

<h4>Examples</h4>

<ul>
<li>Run five minutes after midnight, every day: <ul><li><span class='keyword'>5 0 * * *</span></li></ul></li>
<li>Run at 2:15pm on the first of every month: <ul><li><span class='keyword'>15 14 1 * *</span></li></ul></li>
<li>Run at 10 pm on weekdays: <ul><li><span class='keyword'>* 22 * * 1-5</span></li></ul></li>
<li>Run every 12 hours: <ul><li><span class='keyword'>* */12 * * *</span></li></ul></li>
</ul>

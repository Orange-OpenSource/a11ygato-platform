// Here I'm extracting the content of main.less from bootstrap cause it seems that this file has been modified several times by my predecessors.
// And I don't like the idea to modify directly a library we depends on.
// Now we can safely deactivate what we don't use in bootstrap and override whatever we want like the theme.
// It seems that bootswatch with the flatly theme has been used to customise bootstrap look.
